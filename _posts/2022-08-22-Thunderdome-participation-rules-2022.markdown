We over at Death Guild Thunderdome take death very seriously because *she is always listening*  so we wanted to give you the update for participation at Burning Man this year!

Come on out, Thunderdome is here and OPEN for your consensual violence opportunities 4:45 and Esplanade, starting at approximately 9pm M-F.

A few new things we need from you this year to participate!

- You must find your own partner - bring someone or pick up outside the dome.  
- For OUR safety and yours, fighters will be asked to wear a mask while in line and up to getting strapped up for your battle! **Please bring your own KN95 or N95!**
- Please donâ€™t come to fight if you have covid-19 symptoms, are running a fever, have a rash or sores on your face, hands or crotch!  Get that shit checked out!
- **YOU MUST WEAR UNDERWEAR.** No exceptions.  Keep your crotch off our junk! (*some exceptions, outside the dome, apply)
- Want to bring us a gift? We love gifts!  And we love to be nice to people who give us gifts! Unopened bottles of booze, WEARING YOUR OWN KN95/N95 mask, or showing us a copy of your vaxxed and boosted card are always appreciated and help your wait to fight get a little shorter!
