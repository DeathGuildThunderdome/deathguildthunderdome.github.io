Do you want to join Death Guild Thunderdome? Help us build the Dome and put on fights? Let's say it up front… it’s not easy. We’re looking for hardworkers who aren’t afraid to learn something new while collaborating with our eclectic group of miscreants. The best way to do that is to come to one of our [events](/events/) and ask to help.

Death Guild Thunderdome works with a sponsorship system, where established members must represent a new member to the group until that person has proven they have what it takes to be part of Thunderdome. It’s not impossible! But “sparkleponies” may not want to apply.
