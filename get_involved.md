Do you want to join Death Guild Thunderdome? Help us build the Dome and put on the show? We’ll say it up front: it’s not easy. We’re looking for hard workers who aren’t afraid to learn something new while collaborating with our eclectic group of miscreants. The best way to do that is to come to one of our events and ask to help out.

Death Guild Thunderdome works on a sponsorship system, wherein established members are responsible for a new member until that person has proven they have what it takes to be part of Thunderdome. It’s not impossible! But “sparkleponies” need not apply.
